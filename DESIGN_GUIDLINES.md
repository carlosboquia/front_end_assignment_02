The three colours I'll be using for my resume are as follows:


#dce0d9 - "Platinum" - almost a greenish/greyish colour that isn't too vibrant. I want to use this for the subheaders or h1/h2's of the page

#fbf6ef - "Floral White" - what most of the page is going to be to give the colour a better astethic

#ead7c3 - "Almond" - The more darkest of the colours. I want these to represent the header and hard skills for my resume


Fonts: I'll be using Raleway and Helvetic
- I chose this due to it's clean modern look.
