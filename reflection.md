Reflection - Assignment 1

1. The functionality of my code consists of building out a resume with a little bit of personality. I built out the structure of the code using the HTML5 docttype declaration to ensure it meets modern web standards. By organizing the segments into sections, I was able to utilize specific commands such as h1, h2, section, li, etc to meet the projects objectives. 

2. I followed the instructions step by step to start. However, I got ahead of myself and added segments that were later to be added in future steps. I wanted to organize by completing the HTML5 doctype first. I then proceeded by adding the <head>, <body>. Afterwards, I wanted to organize by section before inputting the little details. I proceeded to then add hyperlinks, bold and italic specific parts of the page. I completed by cleaning up some of the lines. The best strategy I had for my personally, was adding multiple <li> by inputting li*(number).

3. One challenge I had was how I wanted to “clean” my code. As per the demonstration the <li> would be on two different lines to make for a more easier way to read. But to me personally it was a little confusing at first trying to differentiate between each line. Another issue was creating an UL within an UL. I used W3schools and some research online to help me out.

4. I would try my best to go a linear way of organizing as there were times I would work on one section and go fix another as soon as I decided to change my mind on design or organization. Overall great introduction to front development


Reflection assignment - 2
1. I structured my code surrounding using flexbox for the main three aspects of the page. By adding <div> to bunch up contact info and about me, experience and education and top 5 and clip of the week. I was able to have align properly. As for the skills section I used the grid method by having the listed items be listed as a grid. 

2. The way I went on planning was going though each instruction as listed in the notes. I wanted to use flexbox for the whole page but ran into issues with the skills section and couldnt apply grid and display:flex at the same time. As for organizing, I went through the layout first and wanted the three side-by-side sections to be the same. afterwards i went and cleaned every section to make sure the margins, padding, etc were uniform. I then completed the header and footer last. as for the details, I went from top to bottom in terms of design

3. The biggest challenged I faced was menitoned in the 2nd answer. I had skills and experience together and I couldn't figure out a way to have the skills be listed as grid while being displayed as the other classes. so i had to update my html file to have the skills have its own ID so that i can apply grid. 

4. I would use the grid method instead of flex as the flex gave me too many limitations in terms of applying other ways to organize whats on the page.
