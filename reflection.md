Reflection

1. The functionality of my code consists of building out a resume with a little bit of personality. I built out the structure of the code using the HTML5 docttype declaration to ensure it meets modern web standards. By organizing the segments into sections, I was able to utilize specific commands such as h1, h2, section, li, etc to meet the projects objectives. 

2. I followed the instructions step by step to start. However, I got ahead of myself and added segments that were later to be added in future steps. I wanted to organize by completing the HTML5 doctype first. I then proceeded by adding the <head>, <body>. Afterwards, I wanted to organize by section before inputting the little details. I proceeded to then add hyperlinks, bold and italic specific parts of the page. I completed by cleaning up some of the lines. The best strategy I had for my personally, was adding multiple <li> by inputting li*(number).

3. One challenge I had was how I wanted to “clean” my code. As per the demonstration the <li> would be on two different lines to make for a more easier way to read. But to me personally it was a little confusing at first trying to differentiate between each line. Another issue was creating an UL within an UL. I used W3schools and some research online to help me out.

4. I would try my best to go a linear way of organizing as there were times I would work on one section and go fix another as soon as I decided to change my mind on design or organization. Overall great introduction to front development
